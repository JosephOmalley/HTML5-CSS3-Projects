	<body>
	<link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "Basic_css_2.css">
	<p>This is an example of the link tag in HTML</p>
	<p>In html some characters can not can not be used directly. Why? because some already have a purpose
	and using them will confuse the computer. so thats where HTML entities come into play. So if I wanted to 
	use the less than symbol I would simply write <strong>& #60</strong> but put the & and the #60 together.</p>
	<h3>Ex. &#60</h3>
